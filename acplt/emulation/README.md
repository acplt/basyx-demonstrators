# Emulation

A Unity 3D project to create a simulation of an exemplary production process for plastic tins with lids.
To differenciate between additional simulations, e.g. FMUs for single process steps or cells, which were evaluated in BaSys4.2, we call the simulation of the whole production process an emulation.
In our use cases this emulation is considered as the "real" plant.
